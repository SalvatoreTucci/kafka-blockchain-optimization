Kafka Performance Test Summary
==============================
Test: high-throughput
Date: mer 24 set 2025 21:16:11
Configuration: .env.high-throughput
Status: COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

=== Configuration Parameters ===
Batch Size: 131072 bytes
Linger Time: 20 ms
Compression: snappy
Buffer Memory: 134217728 bytes
Network Threads: 6
IO Threads: 12

=== Performance Results ===
Producer Throughput: 999.417007 records/sec
Total Records Sent: 12000
Average Latency: 12.55 ms
Maximum Latency: 335.00 ms

Consumer Throughput: N/A records/sec
Consumer Data Rate: N/A MB/sec

=== System Resources ===
CONTAINER ID   NAME      CPU %     MEM USAGE / LIMIT     MEM %     NET I/O           BLOCK I/O        PIDS
3ec8ad5a0d67   kafka     1.32%     553.7MiB / 7.434GiB   7.27%     75.8kB / 97.8kB   2.04MB / 114MB   93

=== Research Analysis ===
This test establishes baseline performance with the specified configuration.
Results can be compared with Paper 2/3 literature baselines (~1000 TPS target).

Paper Comparison:
- Target TPS: 1000 (Paper 2/3 baseline)
- Measured TPS: 999.417007
- Status: âœ“ Good baseline established

=== Files Generated ===
- producer-test.log: Detailed producer performance metrics
- consumer-test.log: Detailed consumer performance metrics
- docker-stats.txt: System resource usage during test
- topics.txt: Kafka topic information

=== Next Steps ===
1. If results look good: test optimized configurations
2. Compare with optimizations: ./scripts/simple-kafka-test.sh .env.batch-optimized
3. Run analysis: python3 scripts/analyze-simple-results.py results/high-throughput_20250924_211445
4. Generate research findings

=== Troubleshooting (if results are poor) ===
- Increase Docker memory allocation (4GB+ recommended)
- Check: docker stats (during test)
- Check: docker-compose logs kafka
- Try: docker-compose down -v && docker system prune -f
