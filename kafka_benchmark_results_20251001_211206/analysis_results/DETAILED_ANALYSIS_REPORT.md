**Total Tests Analyzed**: 4

## Executive Summary

### Top Performers

- **Highest Throughput**: **high-throughput** (3909.0 records/sec)
- **Lowest Latency**: **high-throughput** (642.80 ms)
- **Best Efficiency**: **high-throughput** (6.1 records/sec/ms)

## Detailed Results

| Test | Status | Throughput (rec/s) | Latency (ms) | CPU % | Memory % | Config Highlights |
|------|--------|-------------------|--------------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| baseline | SUCCESS | 3129.4 | 917.14 | 2.0 | 0.0 | Batch: 16384, Linger: 0ms, Compression: none |
| batch-optimized | SUCCESS | 3575.9 | 828.68 | 1.9 | 0.0 | Batch: 65536, Linger: 10ms, Compression: none |
| high-throughput | SUCCESS | 3909.0 | 642.80 | 1.4 | 0.0 | Batch: 131072, Linger: 25ms, Compression: none |
| low-latency | SUCCESS | 2781.9 | 883.06 | 2.0 | 0.0 | Batch: 8192, Linger: 0ms, Compression: none |


## Recommendations

Based on the analysis results:

1. **For High Throughput**: Use configuration similar to `high-throughput` which achieved 3909 records/sec

3. **For Best Balance**: Consider `high-throughput` configuration for optimal throughput/latency ratio
